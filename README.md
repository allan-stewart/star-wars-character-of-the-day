# Star Wars Character of the Day

This simple program was created as an exercise in dependency injection and unit testing w/ Mocks.
It calls the [Star Wars API](https://swapi.co/) to get characters, picks a random one and displays it.

To run the program:

```
cd CharacterOfTheDay
dotnet run
```

To run the unit tests:

```
cd UnitTests
dotnet watch test
```

If you'd like to start over from the beginning of the exercise:

```
git checkout start-here
```
